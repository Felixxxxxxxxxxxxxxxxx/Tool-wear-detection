Tool wear detection using Deep learning

Using Unet to do tool wear detection. The training dataset are sets of tools.

The aim is to apply different incrementally learning methods to incrementally learn features. Methods include EWC, LWF and so on.

The dataset is trained on the HPC cluster of RWTH.
